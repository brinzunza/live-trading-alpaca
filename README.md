# live-trading-alpaca
This is a basic trading bot that interacts with the Alpaca API to buy and sell stocks or cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin). The bot is built using Python and the alpaca-trade-api library to execute trades. This example is set up to trade Bitcoin (BTC/USD) on the Alpaca paper trading account.

## Features

	•	Buy and Sell Orders: You can submit market buy and sell orders for any symbol supported by Alpaca (e.g., stocks, crypto).
	•	Alpaca API Integration: Uses Alpaca’s REST API for submitting orders.
	•	Paper Trading: Interact with Alpaca’s paper trading system for testing without real money.
